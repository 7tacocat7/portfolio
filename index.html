              </div>

                <p>My name is Carson Canales. <span class="important">I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas</span>.I was raised in a modest household, with one brother and two loving parents. My mother was a teacher and my father a judge. My heritage is hispanic. English is my first language, however i also speak spanish. In my junior year of highschool i was fortunate enough to live on the island of Tenerife, which is both the biggest island in the Canary islands and the tallest mountain in Spain. The time spent overseas has given me cultural diversity and life experience that i value greatly. Due to this experience, as you might expect, I have become an avid traveler and adventurer. In my most recent travels i voyaged to 12 different countries accross Europe over the span of 4 months. Traveling, however, is not my only passion! I have many hobbies and passions. Here are a few; technology, robotics, software development, hardware development, manufacturing, industrial design, skateboarding, animation, cinima, running!!! "

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>My education and job experience have been quite diverse. I graduated with a Bachlors in Psychology from Texas State University in 2012. While attending university i had many different jobs ranging from non-profit work to structural welding.  After graduation i found work in the sales department of a company called Yodle. at Yodle i sold various SEO/SEM marketing pacakges to small to medium sized buisnesses. After deciding to switch career paths, i took 4 months off to travel and visit friends across Europe. When i arrived back in the States, i decided to move to Las Vegas, Nevada and quickly obtained work for Ameriprise financial. At Ameriprise financial i trained for the sieres 7 while working as a client service coordinator. My time at the company was very valuable but ultimitaly i decided finance wasnt a good career move for myself. Shortly after leaving the company I moved to Portland. Here i am today. here i am to stay! </p>
